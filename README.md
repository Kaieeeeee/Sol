# Solidity Test
This is a solidity assessment in Metacrafters with this I can test and experiment on how the code works.

## Description
This solidity test serves as my assessment here in Metacrafters. I am looking forward to execute this correctly and have a knowledge in solidity. This project showcases how to make a mint and burn tokens using functions.

### Getting Started
1. To execute this you will need Remix. https://remix.ethereum.org/

2. Copy the code then paste it on remix! viola! (Remember to put .sol at the end)

Other notes: The code does not work on my end with pragma 0.8.18, I used pragma  0.8.26.
